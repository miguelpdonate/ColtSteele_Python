""" Bank Robbery Exercise
I just robbed a bank with some of my friends. 
We got away with $19,867,324,678,987.99, and now we have to split it up 5 ways. 
Using the cash  variable I've already defined for you, print out the dollar amount each robber gets to keep. 
(divide cash  by 5 and print the answer out)

p.s. I haven't actually robbed a bank.  Yet."""

cash = 19867324678987.99  # DON'T CHANGE THE CASH VARIABLE

# ADD YOUR CODE BELOW:
print(cash / 5)




"""Make Some Variables!
Now that we've learned about variables and data types, let's get some practice.  Or, skip this! Totally up to you!

Define a variable named city  and set it equal to any string
Define a variable named price  and set it equal to any float
Define a variable named high_score  and set it equal to any int
Define a variable named is_having_fun  and set it to a boolean value
You do not need to print them out, but can if you want."""


# Define a variable named city and set it equal to any string

# Define a variable named price and set it equal to any float

# Define a variable named high_score and set it equal to any int

# Define a variable named is_having_fun and set it to a Boolean value
city = "New York"
price = 5.6
high_score = 7
is_having_fun = True





"""Escape Sequence Practice
Get some practice with escape sequences!  
NO need to create new variables, 
just use the existing variables we have created for you and follow the instructions. :) """


 # Set the message variable equal to any string containing a new-line escape sequence
message = "Hello \n goodbye"
 
# Add a string to the mountains variable that when printed results in: /\/\/\
# You will need to use an escape sequence more than once!
 
mountains = "/\\/\\/\\"
 
 
# Set the quotation variable to any string that contains an escaped double quotation mark
quotation = "My cat said \"meow\""





"""String Concatenation Exercise
Set the variable called greeting  to some greeting, e.g. "hello".

Set the variable called name  to some name, e.g. "Heisenberg".

Then set the variable called greet_name  so that it concatenates greeting , name , and a space " " between them."""

greeting = "Hi"
name = "Miguel"
greet_name = greeting + " " + name



"""Formatting Strings
Set the variable called first  to your first name.

Set the variable called last  to your last name.

Then set the variable called formatted  to a new string that interpolates both values (from the first and last variables) using f-strings or the .format()  method.  Make sure you follow this exact pattern for the new string that you store to the formatted variable (pay attention to capital/lowercase letters, spaces, commas, etc):

"First Name: Colt, Last Name: Steele"""

first = "Miguel"
last = "Perez"

formatted = f"First Name: {first}, Last Name: {last}"
